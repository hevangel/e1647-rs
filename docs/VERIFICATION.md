# Verification log

Append-only log of verification work: exact commands, results, scope and
known limitations. A successful build alone does not verify acceptance; every
claim here must name the command that backs it.

## 2026-10-25 — issue #1 staged front-end work (branch `agent/issue-1-foundation`)

Scope claimed for this change (nothing broader):

- Tokenizer: keyword recognition, multi-character operators, sized/unsized
  numeral and bit-literal handling, same token stream contract as before.
- Parser: recursive-descent parser for the declared subset (struct / unit /
  extend declarations, field declarations, scalar and list types, `keep`
  constraint expressions, `like` inheritance clause) with spanned
  diagnostics and error recovery at declaration level.
- Minimal well-formedness checks: duplicate field names, unknown named types,
  duplicate declaration names. **This is not full symbol/type checking.**
- CLI: `e1647 parse <file>` command with diagnostic output and exit codes.
- Reference-parsing support: EDA Playground credentials handling (`.env`),
  reference repository pins under `external/`, governance documents.

Commands and results (toolchain `1.99.1-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, run locally on
Windows; identical commands run in CI on ubuntu-latest via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```
$ cargo fmt --all -- --check
(no output — pass)

$ cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
    Checking e1647-rs v0.1.0
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.05s
(pass, zero warnings)

$ cargo test --all-targets
test result: ok. 0 passed;  0 failed  (unittests src/lib.rs)
test result: ok. 0 passed;  0 failed  (unittests src/main.rs)
test result: ok. 1 passed;  0 failed  (test fixtures.rs — golden diagnostics)
test result: ok. 12 passed; 0 failed  (test lexer.rs)
test result: ok. 10 passed; 0 failed  (test parser.rs)
```

Manual CLI checks run additionally (not part of CI):

```
$ cargo run -- parse examples/packet.e        # prints the AST, exit 0
$ cargo run -- parse /tmp/bad.e               # duplicate field fixture
/tmp/bad.e:3:3: error[E0202]: duplicate field 'a'   (exit 1)
```

Known limitations after this change (still true unless a later entry says
otherwise):

- No type checking beyond the duplicate/unknown-name checks above; no `when`,
  no method declarations, no temporal expressions, no events, no coverage.
- Tokenizer/parse results are validated against our own fixtures plus
  cross-checks of the pinned MIT-licensed grammars, not against the IEEE
  1647 text (lawful personal copy kept locally under `local/`, not committed).
- Specman reference-run evidence via EDA Playground is recorded separately
  below when performed; absence of an entry means it has not been done.

## Reference-simulator runs (EDA Playground)

- **2026-10-25 — first attempt blocked.** Automated login to
  edaplayground.com with the `.env` account was blocked by reCAPTCHA
  Enterprise (`loginpage?error=captcha` twice). No CAPTCHA solving is
  performed by policy. Recorded in full in the PR #2 description.
- **2026-10-26 — example prepared and saved; run blocked by account
  validation.** The owner logged in manually in the automation browser.
  Independently authored example `examples/reference_subset.e` (struct with
  `uint(bits: 8)` / `nibble` / `list of` fields and `keep` constraints,
  `extend` with a constraint, `struct ... like`, `gen`/`print`, based
  literals `8'hFF`, `0b1010`, `0o17` in `out()`) was entered into the
  testbench editor with language **Specman e + SV/Verilog** and simulator
  **Cadence Xcelium 25.03** (Specman 2025.03), and saved at
  <https://www.edaplayground.com/x/7Jrh>. Clicking Run opens
  `validatedAccessRequiredModal`: **"Your account is not validated"** —
  commercial simulators require a validated account. The confirmation email
  resend (`/resendConfirmation`) was requested. **Run output is therefore
  still not available**; the follow-up is owner-only: click the validation
  link in the mailbox of the `.env` account (check spam), then re-run the
  saved playground and record the log here. `'h`/`'x` hex and `0o` remain
  grammar-confirmed only until that run happens.
