# Verification log

Append-only log of verification work: exact commands, results, scope and
known limitations. A successful build alone does not verify acceptance; every
claim here must name the command that backs it.

## 2026-10-25 — issue #1 staged front-end work (branch `agent/issue-1-foundation`)

Scope claimed for this change (nothing broader):

- Tokenizer: keyword recognition, multi-character operators, sized/unsized
  numeral and bit-literal handling, same token stream contract as before.
- Parser: recursive-descent parser for the declared subset (struct / unit /
  extend declarations, field declarations, scalar and list types, `keep`
  constraint expressions, `like` inheritance clause) with spanned
  diagnostics and error recovery at declaration level.
- Minimal well-formedness checks: duplicate field names, unknown named types,
  duplicate declaration names. **This is not full symbol/type checking.**
- CLI: `e1647 parse <file>` command with diagnostic output and exit codes.
- Reference-parsing support: EDA Playground credentials handling (`.env`),
  reference repository pins under `external/`, governance documents.

Commands and results (toolchain `1.99.1-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, run locally on
Windows; identical commands run in CI on ubuntu-latest via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```
$ cargo fmt --all -- --check
(no output — pass)

$ cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
    Checking e1647-rs v0.1.0
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.05s
(pass, zero warnings)

$ cargo test --all-targets
test result: ok. 0 passed;  0 failed  (unittests src/lib.rs)
test result: ok. 0 passed;  0 failed  (unittests src/main.rs)
test result: ok. 1 passed;  0 failed  (test fixtures.rs — golden diagnostics)
test result: ok. 12 passed; 0 failed  (test lexer.rs)
test result: ok. 10 passed; 0 failed  (test parser.rs)
```

Manual CLI checks run additionally (not part of CI):

```
$ cargo run -- parse examples/packet.e        # prints the AST, exit 0
$ cargo run -- parse /tmp/bad.e               # duplicate field fixture
/tmp/bad.e:3:3: error[E0202]: duplicate field 'a'   (exit 1)
```

Known limitations after this change (still true unless a later entry says
otherwise):

- No type checking beyond the duplicate/unknown-name checks above; no `when`,
  no method declarations, no temporal expressions, no events, no coverage.
- Tokenizer/parse results are validated against our own fixtures plus
  cross-checks of the pinned MIT-licensed grammars, not against the IEEE
  1647 text (lawful personal copy kept locally under `local/`, not committed).
- Specman reference-run evidence via EDA Playground is recorded separately
  below when performed; absence of an entry means it has not been done.

## Reference-simulator runs (EDA Playground)

- **2026-10-25 — attempted, not completed.** Automated login to
  edaplayground.com with the `.env` account was blocked by reCAPTCHA
  Enterprise: two legitimate attempts (checkbox interaction + form submit)
  both returned `loginpage?error=captcha`. No CAPTCHA-solving is performed by
  policy, so no Specman reference run was executed in this session.
  Consequence: the `'h`-style hexadecimal spelling accepted by our lexer is
  confirmed against the pinned MIT-licensed editor grammar
  (`external/vscode-specman-grammar`: sized hex `[hHxX]`; the
  `external/specman-e-parser` flex accepts `[xXfF]`; our lexer accepts the
  union and is lenient) but is **not yet confirmed against real Specman**.
  Follow-up (needs the owner): log in manually in the automation browser
  once, or provide a pre-authenticated browser profile; then run the
  independently authored subset example and record its log here.
